			<h4>is passionate about Web Application Development!</h4>
			<p class="description">
			Markus is an informatics master's student at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tum.de">TU Munich</a>.
			When he was just eleven years old, Markus discovered the joy of programming at an elective Java school course. Even though he did not understand quite a lot of his teacher's code, he realized that programming is a lot of fun. After pursuing various interests in school (including leading development of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hhg-muenchen.de">school website</a>, being chief editor of the school newspaper and participating at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.f1inschools.com/">F1 in Schools</a> World Finals in Singapore) and graduating as top of his class, he started studying informatics in 2012 - there couldn't have been a better choice!</p>
			<p class="description">
				I am looking for interesting projects related to Web Application Development! Work is possible as freelancer, working student or intern. <a target="_blank" href="mailto:mail@muellermarkus.com">Contact me!</a>
